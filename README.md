# SMSTC-Numerical-Methods
This repo will slowly be populated with some example implementations of some of the algorithms introduced in [SMSTC Numerical Methods](https://smstc.ac.uk/my-smstc/students/modules/2019-2020-numerical-methods "SMSTC website").

### Work in Progress!

## SDEs -- Des Higham
For MATLAB implementations see [the website](http://personal.strath.ac.uk/d.j.higham/algfiles.html). Note that the links to the files on Des' Edinburgh webpage do not work, make sure you're on the old Strathclyde one!
